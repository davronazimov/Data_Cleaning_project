# Introduction 
In this project, I worked with US üè† household income data to perform data cleaning tasks. The objective was to prepare the data for exploratory data analysis üîé (EDA) to gain insights into income distribution üìä trends.

# Background
The motivation behind this project was to conduct exploratory data analysis on US household income data. However, before diving into analysis, it was essential to ensure the data was clean and structured appropriately. Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data analysis project as it ensures the accuracy and reliability of insights derived from the data.

# Tools Used
For this project, I utilized several tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database.
- **MySQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the US Household Income data.
- **VSCode:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Analysis
The data cleaning process involved several steps:

- Renaming columns: I renamed [columns](/1_Renaming_column.sql) to ensure consistency and clarity in the dataset.
- Identifying and removing duplicates: Using subqueries, I detected and deleted [duplicate](/2_Checking_Duplicates_On_Income_Tb.sql) entries in the dataset.
- Updating columns: I corrected misspellings and filled missing values in certain [columns](/3_Updating_Columns.sql) to enhance the integrity of the data.

# What I Learned
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in:

Working with **SQL** and **MySQL** for data manipulation and management.
Understanding the importance of data cleaning in the analysis process.
Utilizing **Git** and **GitHub** for version control and collaboration, ensuring project organization and reproducibility.

# Conclusions
Data cleaning is a critical step in the data analysis process. By ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the dataset, we can trust the insights derived from it. This project not only provided me with practical experience in data cleaning but also laid the groundwork for further analysis of US household income data. Moving forward, I plan to conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover meaningful patterns and trends in the dataset.
